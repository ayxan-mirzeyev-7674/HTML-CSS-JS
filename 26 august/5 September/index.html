    <h1>Pac-Man</h1>
    <h2>General Information</h2>
    <p>
      Pac-Man is an arcade video game released in 1980, developed by the
      Japanese company Namco. The player's task is to control Pacman to eat all
      the points in the maze, avoiding meeting the ghosts that are chasing the
      hero.
    </p>
    <p>
      In Japan, the created game was called Puck-Man (<b>Japanese pakkuman</b>),
      but when localized in the US, Midway changed the name to Pac-Man,
      believing that with the original name, children could paint over the
      middle of the P, turning it into an F, and making the word obscene.
    </p>
    <h2>Game Characters</h2>
    <p>
      The main character Pacman was made friendly so people could associate
      themselves with him. The role of enemies in Pac-Man is played by four
      colorful ghosts:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Blinky</b> : A red ghost, stalking Pacman without much fuss.</li>
      <li>
        <b>Pinky</b> : A pink ghost that targets a position 32 pixels from the
        front of the protagonist.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Inca</b> : a blue ghost trying to get to a point found using a
        special algorithm, taking into account the position of the following
        objects:
        <ol>
          <li>player;</li>
          <li>another ghost - Blinky.</li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Clyde</b> : an orange ghost, which, depending on the distance from
        the main character, chases Pacman, then goes to the lower left corner of
        the maze.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Level 256</h2>

    <p>
      The first person to beat Pac-Man was American Billy Mitchell. When the
      creator of the game, Tohru iwatani, met with him, Billy asked if some of
      the features he discovered had been deliberately allowed.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i
        >Iwatani consulted with colleagues and replied as follows: Mr. Mitchell.
        We do not know. The game was not supposed to last that long.</i
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      As conceived by the developers, Pac-Man was not supposed to have an end,
      since the increasing complexity of the game would not allow it to go far.
      However, some players were able to complete 255 levels of the game, which
      took several hours, and at 256 level they discovered the manifestation of
      a programming error in the form of a «screen of death».

      As conceived by the developers, Pac-Man was not supposed to have an end,
      since the increasing complexity of the game would not allow it to go far.
      However, some players were able to complete 255 levels of the game, which
      took several hours, and at 256 level they discovered the manifestation of
      a programming error in the form of a «screen of death».
    </p>
    <img src="" alt="level 256" />
    <p>
      The reason for this error is the procedure that calculates the bonuses
      under the maze. When level 256 is reached, it loads the value 255 into the
      CPU register and increments it by one. 255 is the maximum value that can
      fit in a Zilog Z80 processor register, so when incremented by 1, an
      integer overflow occurs and zero is written to the register.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the register value is less than 7, then the subroutine considers that
      this is one of the first levels on which to draw bonus symbols. After
      drawing, the register (currently equal to zero) is decremented by or and a
      «bottom overflow» occurs: a negative number cannot be written in the
      register, and 255 is placed in it. The drawing cycle is performed with
      decreasing the register value until it becomes equal to 0 (i.e. 256
      times). The images of bonuses in the game are stored in a special table.
      Since its size is less than 256, the subroutine leaves the table and
      starts using data that is not intended for this.
    </p>
    <h2>Reprints</h2>
    <p>
      In 2010, on the 30th anniversary of the game, Google introduced a thematic
      <a href="#"
        >«doodle». The maze design was a Google logo, but the graphics, sounds,
        and ghost behavior patterns copied the original game. When you press the
        «Insert coin» button again, Mrs. Pacman appears on the screen, and the
        game can be played together on the same keyboard.</a
