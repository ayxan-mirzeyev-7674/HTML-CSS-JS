        Popularly known as the 'Father of the Digital World', Steve Jobs an
        American entrepreneur, investor, co-founder of Apple Inc. Not the one to
        be satisfied with a single achievement, he moved on to make history in
        the world of consumer electronics with his foray into the music and
        cellular industry. The founder of Apple Inc, Pixar Animation Studios and
        NeXT Inc, Jobs gave information technology its life and blood. A master
        of innovation, he was known for his perfectionist attitude and
        futuristics line ofvolution in his field with his novel ideas and unique
        concepts. During his years at the Apple, he administered the development
        of the iMac, Tunes, iPod, iPhone, and iPad. He was the mastermind behind
        the working of the company's Apple Retail Stores, Tunes Store and the
        App Store. Interestingly, with so much to fall back upon, it is quite
        amusing to know that this legendary innovator was not much educated, in
        fact a college dropout.

        Ever since a young age, Jobs was exposed to the world of mechanics. He
        would spent long hours with his father, dismantling and rebuilding
        electronic devices in the family garage. It was these experiences that
        gave the little boy tenacity and mechanical prowess.
