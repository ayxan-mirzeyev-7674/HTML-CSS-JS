          <h1>JavaScript</h1>
          <p class="author">Sam Rubik</p>
          <p class="article">
            JavaScript is a programming language that conforms to the ECMAScript
            specification. JavaScript is high-level, often just-in-time
            compiled, and multi-paradigm. It has curly-bracket syntax, dynamic
            typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class
            functions.

            Alongside HTML and CSS, JavaScript is one of the core technologies
            of the World Wide Web. JavaScript enables interactive web pages and
            is an essential part of web applications. The vast majority of
            websites use it for client-side page behavior, and all major web
            browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute it.
          </p>
          <p class="article">
            As a multi-paradigm language, JavaScript supports event-driven,
            functional, and imperative programming styles. It has application
            programming interfaces (APls) for working with text, dates, regular
            expressions, standard data structures, and the Document Object Model
            (DOM). However, the language itself does not include any
            input/output (1/0), such as networking, storage, or graphics
            facilities, as the host environment (usually a web browser) provides
            those APls.

            JavaScript engines were originally used only in web browsers, but
            they are now embedded in some servers, usually via Node. js. They
            are also embedded in a variety of applications created with
            frameworks such as Electron and Cordova.
          </p>

            Although there are similarities between JavaScript and Java,
            including language name, syntax, and respective standard libraries,
            the two languages are distinct and differ greatly in design.
